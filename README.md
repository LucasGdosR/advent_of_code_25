# AoC 2025

For this year's AoC, my challenge is making a single program that solves the entire AoC. The constraints are:

- Problems must be solved sequentially (day X + 1 can only be solved after day X is solved);
- All solutions must be written to the same file;
- The entire code is multi-threaded.

I was inspired by this [article](https://www.rfleury.com/p/multi-core-by-default) to make this multi-threaded in a simple way.
